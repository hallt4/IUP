Topic #2: Creative, pleasant, mobile user interface creation

The most important part of mobile design is to maximize space, a lot of things that are fine on deskop make for a terrible user experience
on mobile. Most ads and supplemental features should be eliminated completely, leaving only the core product. Content should fill the
screen. Navigation should be expandable when needed. Creativity in design can be great, as long as it does not interfere with the fast, 
easy accessability for which mobile devices are used and optimized.
